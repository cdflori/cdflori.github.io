# cdflori.github.io

Fot this project I wanted to have a website that reflected my design aesthetic. I consider this version to be a building block to a much more advanced site by the end of term.

https://cdflori.github.io/

I made three separate pages for this site. You will find them below.

## About Me

![About Me Page](/index.html)

For this page I used Bootstrap grid system to create a template for my site. I made my profile photo, descriptors, and social icons a permanent left side class. Then I designated the right side class/col for my pages content. In this case a jumbotron with bio information and resume/project links. 

## Portfolio Page

For this page I used my same template layout but included a card gallery to display future work. I used flex bot variable to create uniform padding around cards.

## Contact Page

![Contact Page](/contact.html)

For this page I used the same template layout but included a contact form with the following information: Name, Email, Project Details with a submit buttons.

### CSS

![CSS Sheet](/assets/css/style.css)

I have made several style modifications to the style.css sheet for my site. The majority are for the template grid system used on each page.
